# CFSTsteel
CFSTsteel model is an uniaxial material model which can be used to simulate the cyclic behavior of steel tube in concrete-filled steel tube beam-columns including local buckling. The source code associated with the CFSTsteel uniaxial material model will be uploaded subsequent to the finalization of the debugging phase.
